## Introduction

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy weekday challenge(5). My task was to create a working "thermostat" app, with an adjustable temperature gauge. My app needed to satisfy the following requirements:

## Specification

- The thermostat starts at 20 degrees.
- The user can increase the temperature with an up function.
- The user can decrease the temperature with a down function.
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees.
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees.
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees.
- Power saving mode is on by default.
- The user can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function.
- The user can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
